## **Current Vision**

## Project: Fourth and Context

**Primary Stakeholder:** 

NFL Coaches/analysts making decision on whether or not to "go for it" on 4th down. NFL rule change committee on deciding whether or not to keep the kickoff rule change in effect. 

**Secondary Stakeholders:**
- NFL fans interested in the subject
- NFL broadcasters looking to provide accurate and interesting information
- Players looking to be informed by analytics

**Problem Statement:**
Currently, models evaluate 4th down situations using down/distance, score, and team strength as the main factors determining whether or not to go for it. This ignores momentum, team tendencies, and formations of the players. Suggestions aren't made with enough specificity to the situation.

**Solution:** 
We will build a machine learning model that predicts the success/likelihood of all possible outcomes (punt, kick, run a play, take delay of game penalty, draw encroachment penalty) based on all available relevant information.
