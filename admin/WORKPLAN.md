**Active Tasks**

**Milestone 1:** *Data Acquisition & Pre-processing (Week 4)*

*Focus:* Getting nflFastR data, manual coach data, and initial merging.

✅ Draft and finalize Project Proposal text (All)

⏳ Write script to pull nflFastR play-by-play data for 2022-2024 seasons (JW)

⏳ Create manual dataset of offensive/defensive playcallers per week (FG)

⏳ Implement data joining pipeline (nflFastR + Playcaller data) (GS)

⏳ Filter and clean dataset for specific 4th down and kickoff contexts (JW)

✅ Submit Project Proposal (All)

**Milestone 2:** *Dimensionality Reduction & Feature Engineering (Week 5)*

*Focus:* Preparing variables for modeling and exploring the feature space.

[ ] Encode categorical variables (formations, teams) for analysis (GS)

[ ] Perform PCA on game-situation variables to identify key variance drivers (JW)

[ ] Generate correlation heatmap for 4th down success factors (FG)

[ ] Draft and submit Weekly Update (Week 5) (All)

**Milestone 3:** *Clustering Analysis (Weeks 6-7)*

*Focus:* Grouping 4th down scenarios into distinct "types" for context.

[ ] Implement K-Means clustering on 4th down situational vectors (GS)

[ ] Analyze Elbow method/Silhouette score to determine optimal $k$ clusters (JW)

[ ] Visualize clusters (t-SNE or PCA projection) to interpret "Scenario Types" (FG)

[ ] Profile each cluster (e.g., "Desperate 4th & Long" vs "Aggressive Mid-field") (GS)

[ ] Draft and submit Weekly Update (Week 6) (All)

[ ] Draft and submit Weekly Update (Week 7) (All)

**Milestone 4:** *Midterm Report & Initial Modeling (Week 8)*

*Focus:* Compiling findings and setting up the predictive model.

[ ] Train baseline Logistic Regression model for 4th down success (JW)

[ ] Perform hyperparameter tuning on baseline models (GS)

[ ] Compile "Dynamic Kickoff" impact analysis section (FG)
