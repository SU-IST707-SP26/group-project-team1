Topic: NFL 4th Down Decision Making // Fixed-Effects Analysis of Dynamic Kickoff Rule Change
Title: Fourth & Context (still working on it, want to pick something catchier)


Introduction

A big question for NFL coaches is “When do I go for it on 4th down?” Analytics pros working for teams and television networks have created algorithms answering this question in various scenarios. Coaches have a section of their playcall sheet telling them the recommendation in different scenarios. Every broadcast displays their suggestion on 4th downs where going for it is on the table. Currently, the models aren’t very specific to individual scenarios ESPN listed their predictors as: “the score of the game, distance to gain, yard line, clock, timeouts, pregame win probability and the relative strength of the offense and defense on the field” (Walder). We believe that these predictions can be more granular and situation-specific. We want to build a new predictive model that takes many more variables into account, such as pre-snap formations for the offense and defense, coaching tendencies, and in-game effects. 

An additional consideration for us is the year-to-year changes in kickoff rules. The past two seasons have seen the “dynamic kickoff” implemented in all NFL games. The rule change features all blockers and defenders closer together than they traditionally were and stationary until the kick is caught, with the intent of reducing the occurrence of injuries. This initially led to far fewer kick returns happening and the NFL changed the touchback rules (what happens if the ball hits the ground or the returner ‘fair catches’ and gives themselves up) to incentivize returns this past season. A consequence of this is now offenses start with far better field position than in previous seasons, and that changes the risk/reward payoff of going for 4th downs, since getting a field goal and giving the other team the ball at the 35 yard line may not be an optimal outcome of a drive. 

Our predictive model for 4th down scenarios can be utilized by NFL coaches for data-driven decision making that takes more contextual information into account than the models currently available. With the NFL’s kickoff rule changing likely to continue, having a model that can take these changes into account with and accurately suggest 4th down decisions is invaluable to head coaches.
